        I choose to highlight this webiste because I found it while researching for an upcoming web design project. When looking for the best gallery sites on the web, this one came up first. It's actually very similar to the mockup site I created for my project. Except this one is cooler, way cooler. It has a great overall layout and the perfect amount of animated transitions. I really like how the navigation is set up. Hidden navs are my favorite thing right now, and this site exicutes this trend well, while adding functionality. Since this is in fact a gallery website, it makes sense that large hero images are the focal point of the page. The self scolling homepage helps draw the viewer to different exhibitions while displaying the photos at a larger scale, allowing them to take up large amounts of screen realistate. This site is both aesthetically pleasing and functional to its purpose. A+.
