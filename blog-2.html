			<p>
				Lois Jeans is known for pushing boundaries when it comes to creative and unique web design. This site in particular shows off many new design trends. Upon loading the site, a beautiful video background is shown behind the neon signage looking "Ultra Denim' logo. The most impressive aspect of this site is perhaps the simple and edgy scroll navigation. These transitions are exciting and feel very interactive because they move around with your mouse. Moving your cursor left or right over the hero images allow them to move; the models jacket comes off at the 'Look for it' section. Cool stuff!
