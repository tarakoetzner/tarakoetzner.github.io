		<h2>Site of the week: <a href="http://alexgilev.com">Alex Gilev Portfolio</a></h2>
			<p>
				Alex Gilev's porfolio website stands out for its simplicity. He made this site himself, well because that's what he does, he's a designer. The homepage of his site loads with a animated box, with navigation links on the top, bottom, left and right. In the middle, there is a button highlighted that takes you to his portfolio. Above this, there is a message that mimics someone typing in real time. My favorite part about this site are the landing pages. The portfolio and approach pages load to a moving hero image, with a transparent white overlay, where the title of the page is again surrounded by an outlined box, both having no fill to reveal the image behind. I love the type face with the outline box around it. It's something that is very trendy and always makes a statement, no matter how many times you see it done.
