		<p>
Hi-Res! is a creative agency specializing in providing their clients with high end digital work and film production. Upon visiting their domain, a unique animated loading image appears, implied to display the name "Hi / Res." The home page has a moving hero image background. Bubbles float around the screen behind a text box introducing the agency and what they do. The homepage is successful because this type of information is the first thing viewers want to see when visiting a website. There is a prompt to scroll down, plunging the viewer into a realm of selected works, which loads with fluid animated transitions. You can continue to scroll to view the selections, or click on them individually, opening a new tab which further shows off their client work. I recommend viewing their project pages to see what this agency is truly capable of. "Void" in particular, has a window which hijacks your mouse and uses keyboard commands to take the viewer on an interactive parallax journey.
